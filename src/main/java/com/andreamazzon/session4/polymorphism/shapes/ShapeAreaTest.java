/**
 * In this test we show an example of polymorphism. We have an array of shapes
 * and we ask to each member of this array to call the method computing its
 * area. However, until run time we don't know if the members are circles,
 * squares or triangles, as they are selected randomly. However, we are able to
 * do this because the objects of the derived classes get upcasted to the base
 * type when they are created (see the method nextShape() of
 * RandomShapeGenerator). Every object is then treated as a Shape in the array
 * at compilation time, but at run time its special type is recognized and the
 * specific implementation of the method computeArea() is called. This behavior
 * is known as late binding: the code being called isnâ€™t determined until run
 * time
